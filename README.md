# Spatio-Temporal Analysis of UK Traffic Emissions
**Pritha Bera** | *MSc Data Science (University of Birmingham) & MSc Chemistry*

## 📌 Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between traffic density and $CO_2$ emission levels across the United Kingdom. By merging chemical environmental data with traffic flow datasets, this project aims to build a predictive model for regional air quality.

This research serves as a core component of my portfolio for PhD applications in environmental data science, leveraging my background in **Chemistry** (India) and **Data Science** (University of Birmingham).

## 🧪 The "Chemistry + Data" Angle
Unlike standard traffic analyses, this project focuses on:
* **Chemical Stoichiometry:** Mapping vehicle fuel types to specific emission factors.
* **Atmospheric Chemistry:** Factoring in regional air quality benchmarks.
* **Data Science:** Utilizing `geopandas` for spatial mapping and `scikit-learn` for regression modeling.
